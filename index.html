		<p class="welcome">In high school, I took part in a few signature programs that sparked my interest in design and technology. I completed the Academy of Information Technology following the Website Design and Development Pathway. As a member of the program, I took a technology course each year of high school, completed workshops better preparing me for the technology industry, and completed a 200+ hour internship. </p>

		<p class="welcome">I also took part in my school's signature Arts and Humanities program in which I completed a research project on the topic of my choice. I chose to research digital privacy and the implications of agreeing to terms and conditions in our technology-centered world. <a href="assets/images/Christovich SIP.pdf" target="_blank">View my Research Paper!</a> </p>

			<p class="welcome">Aside from these programs, I enjoyed being involved with field hockey, track, lacrosse, and a few honors societies. </p>

	<h3>Work Experience</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>Web and Operations Staff-<i>Koa Sports 2018</i> </h4></li>

		<p>I interned at Koa Sports the summer before my senior year to earn credit for the Academy of Information Technology Program. I created a website for their new basketball program, took photographs at various sports camps, and helped update the main website.</p>

		<li><h4>Field Hockey Coach-<i>Koa Sports 2017</i> </h4></li>

		<p>I gained coaching experience through helping lead a field hockey camp. Being a lover of the game, this was a great opportunity for me to share my skills with others.</p>

		<li><h4>Head Camp Counselor and Schedule Organizer-<i>Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church 2019</i></h4></li>

		<p>The Summer of 2019 I helped my youth minister organize a summer camp for my church. After months of planning, supplies shopping, and scheduling, the camp was a huge success!</p>

		<li><h4>Digital Media Worker-<i>University of Miami/UM Communications 2019-Current</i></h4></li>
		<p>I am currently employed working for the UM Communications Digital Web Team. It has been an amazing experience learning how to edit the websites used across the University. Aside from updating the sites, I have gotten to work behind the scenes of creating the new Engineering site as well as other web tasks.</p>
