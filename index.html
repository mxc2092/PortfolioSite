	<p class="welcome">Hi, I am Margaret Christovich. I am a first year at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. I created this site entirely from scratch to showcase some of my work and practice working with web languages. Throughout high school I became interested in coding and I now continue to combine my passion for art with technology. </p>

		<p class="welcome">In high school, I took part in a few signature programs that sparked my interest in design and technology. I completed the Academy of Information Technology following the Website Design and Development Pathway. As a member of the program, I took a technology course each year of high school, completed workshops better preparing me for the technology industry, and completed a 200+ hour internship. I also took part in my school's signature Arts and Humanities program in which I was surrounded by other students passionate about humanities, placed in more interactive class environments, and completed a research project on the topic of my choice. I chose to research digital privacy and the implications of agreeing to terms and conditions in our technology-centered world. <a href="assets/images/Christovich SIP.pdf" target="_blank">View my Research Paper!</a> Aside from these programs, I enjoyed being involved with field hockey, track, lacrosse, and a few honors societies. </p>

	<h3>Work Experience</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>Web and Operations Staff-<i>Koa Sports 2018</i> </h4></li>

		<p>I interned at Koa Sports the summer before my senior year to earn credit for the Academy of Information Technology Program. I created a website for their new basketball program, took photographs at various sports camps, and helped update the main website.</p>

		<li><h4>Field Hockey Coach-<i>Koa Sports 2017</i> </h4></li>

		<p>I gained coaching experience through helping lead a field hockey camp. Being a lover of the game, this was a great opportunity for me to share my skills with others.</p>

		<li><h4>Head Camp Counselor and Schedule Organizer-<i>Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church 2019</i></h4></li>

		<p>The Summer of 2019 I helped my youth minister organize a summer camp for my church. After months of planning, supplies shopping, and scheduling, the camp was a huge success!</p>

		<li><h4>Digital Media Worker-<i>University of Miami/UM Communications 2019-Current</i></h4></li>
		<p>I am currently employed working for the UM Communications Digital Web Team. It has been an amazing experience learning how to edit the websites used across the University.
