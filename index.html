	<h3>Education</h3>
	<p class="welcome">I graduated from Wootton High School located in Rockville, MD in May 2019. In high school, I completed the Academy of Information Technology following the Website Design and Development Pathway. As a member of the program I took a technology course each year of high school, took part in workshops better preparing me for the technology industry, and completed a 200+ hour internship. I also took part in my school's signature Arts and Hummanities program in which I was surrounded by other students passionate about hummanities, placed in more interactive class environments, and completed a research project on the topic of my choice. I chose to research digital privacy and the implications of aggreeing to terms and conditions in our technology-centered world. <a href="assets/images/Christovich SIP.pdf" target="_blank">View my Research Paper!</a></p>
