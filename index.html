		<p class="welcome">In high school, I took part in a few signature programs that sparked my interest in design and technology. I completed the Academy of Information Technology following the Website Design and Development Pathway. As a member of the program, I took a technology course each year of high school, completed workshops better preparing me for the technology industry, and completed a 200+ hour internship. </p>

		<p class="welcome">I also took part in my school's signature Arts and Humanities program in which I completed a research project on the topic of my choice. I chose to research digital privacy and the implications of agreeing to terms and conditions in our technology-centered world. <a href="assets/images/Christovich SIP.pdf" target="_blank">View my Research Paper!</a> </p>

			<p class="welcome">Aside from these programs, I enjoyed being involved with field hockey, track, lacrosse, and a few honors societies. </p>
